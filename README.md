## Overview
In order to get more familiar with **xor operations** and **xor distances**, you can try the following exercise described in the [Challenge](#challenge) section below. It is based on the challenge I received as a part of an interview.

The `xor-distance-exercise` crate itself is a generic solution for the challenge. The [data](https://github.com/dalibor-matura/xor-distance-exercise/tree/master/data) folder contains a starting point to take on the challenge, so do not peek anywhere else if you intend to find / implement the solution by yourself.

## Challenge

People living in Xor space experience different laws of physics. Instead of location coordinates, places are specified by an unsigned `64-bit` integer. The distance between two points `x` and `y` is not what you are used to from our three linear dimensions space, you have to calculate bitwise xor `x ^ y` of the two locations to get their Xor space distance.

There are entrepreneurs in xor space too and one of them came up with an idea for a local fresh food delivery system:
```rust
pub struct FoodDeliverySystem {
    addresses: Vec<u64>,
}
```
The idea led to a creation of an application. You enter your `position` and a `count` of the closest farms you want to get your food delivered from. It calculate addresses of the nearest farms, ordered from the closest to the `n-th` closest:
```rust
    pub fn closest_farms(&self, position: u64, count: usize) -> Vec<u64> {
        let mut sorted_farms = self.addresses.clone();
        sorted_farms.sort_by_key(|address| *address ^ position);
        sorted_farms.truncate(count);
        sorted_farms
    }
```
The information is handed over to delivery driver and farmers, so that the driver can pick up the food from the furthest farm to the nearest one to maximize freshness of the food when delivered.

Farmers are curious though, they would like to know who their clients are. Theyâ€™ve asked you to write an efficient better than `O(n2)` function (they like to be economical) that, given an ordered sequence of closest farms addresses (from the closest to the `n-th` closest), returns a possible `position` of the customer (there might be more than one such a position, but it just needs to return one of them). If there is no such a `position`, then it should return `None`:
```rust
    pub fn reverse_closest_farms(&self, closest_farms: &[u64]) -> Option<u64> {
        // TODO: This is the part of an exercise you should implement.
        None
    }
```

## Instructions

If you want to solve the presented challenge by yourself then don't look anywhere else than into the [data](https://github.com/dalibor-matura/xor-distance-exercise/tree/master/data) folder.

1. Create a new empty project: `cargo new xor-distance-exercise-impl --lib`
2. Replace its `src/lib.rs` with the [lib.rs](https://github.com/dalibor-matura/xor-distance-exercise/blob/master/data/lib.rs) file (providing structure and tests) from [data](https://github.com/dalibor-matura/xor-distance-exercise/tree/master/data) folder.
3. Replace its `Cargo.toml` with the [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/dalibor-matura/xor-distance-exercise/blob/master/data/Cargo.toml) from [data](https://github.com/dalibor-matura/xor-distance-exercise/tree/master/data) folder.
4. Implement body of the `FoodDeliverySystem::reverse_closest_farms` method to make all tests pass.

Recomendation: Don't try to implement a generic type solution as yet, focus on `u64` type first.

## Additional challenge

You can go and use [Rust generics](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/2018-edition/ch10-00-generics.html) to implement the functionality not just for the `u64` type, but also for the rest of unsigned integer types (e.g. `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u128`, `usize`), as my implementation does.

Warning: This is not an easy task without cheating and checking out how my implementation solves bitwise operations first.
